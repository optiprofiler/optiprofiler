# Problem Set 'S2MPJ' Configuration File
# =============================================================================
#
# This configuration file controls the selection behavior of problem sets
# 'S2MPJ'. The file uses a simple key-value pair format:
#
# parameter_name=parameter_value
#
# Lines starting with # are comments and empty lines are ignored.

# Parameter Descriptions
# =============================================================================
#
# 1. variable_size Parameter
# --------------------------
# Purpose: Determines how to handle problems with variable dimensions/constraints
# 
# Background:
# Some problems in the problem set have variable dimensions and constraint counts
# while maintaining the same problem name. For example, the same problem might 
# have 2D, 5D, 10D versions, or different numbers of constraints.
# 
# Available values and meanings:
# - default: Only select the default dimension and constraint configuration for
#           each problem, ignoring other variable versions
# - min:     For variable problems, select the version with minimum dimensions
#           among all versions that satisfy the selecting criteria
#           (if dimensions are equal, select the one with fewest constraints)
# - max:     For variable problems, select the version with maximum dimensions
#           among all versions that satisfy the selecting criteria  
#           (if dimensions are equal, select the one with most constraints)
# - all:     Return all variable versions that satisfy the selecting criteria
#           without further screening
#
# Example:
# Suppose problem PROBLEM_X has versions: 2D-0constraints, 5D-2constraints, 10D-5constraints
# If selecting criteria is "dimensions <= 8":
# - default: Returns default version (assume 5D-2constraints)
# - min:     Returns 2D-0constraints version (minimum dimensions)
# - max:     Returns 5D-2constraints version (maximum dimensions satisfying criteria)
# - all:     Returns [2D-0constraints, 5D-2constraints] both versions
#
# 2. test_feasibility_problems Parameter
# --------------------------------------
# Purpose: Determines whether to include feasibility problems in the problem set
#
# Background:
# Feasibility problems are a special class of optimization problems where the goal
# is to find a feasible solution that satisfies all constraints, rather than 
# optimizing a specific objective function. These problems are important in certain
# application scenarios but may not be the main focus in standard optimization 
# algorithm testing.
#
# Available values and meanings:
# - 0: Completely exclude feasibility problems
#     All problems marked as feasibility problems will not be included in the 
#     final problem set
# - 1: Include only feasibility problems  
#     Only filter from feasibility problems, regular optimization problems will
#     be excluded
# - 2: Do not distinguish problem types
#     Include both feasibility problems and regular optimization problems as long
#     as they satisfy other selecting criteria
#
# Usage recommendations:
# - If testing standard optimization algorithms, recommend setting to 0
# - If specifically studying feasibility problem solving, recommend setting to 1
# - If wanting a complete comprehensive test set, recommend setting to 2
